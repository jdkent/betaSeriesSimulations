Results included in this manuscript come from modeling
performed using *NiBetaSeries* 0.4.0 [@Kent2018],
which is based on *Nipype* 1.1.9 [@Gorgolewski2011; @Gorgolewski2018].

### Beta Series Modeling

Least squares- separate (LSS) models were generated for each event in the task
following the method described in @Turner2012a, using Nistats 0.0.1b.            
Prior to modeling, preprocessed data were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with a FWHM of 6.0 mm, masked,and mean-scaled over time.
For each trial, preprocessed data were subjected to a general linear model in
which the trial was modeled in its own regressor, while all other trials from
that condition were modeled in a second regressor, and other conditions were
modeled in their own regressors.            Each condition regressor was convolved with a
"glover" hemodynamic response function for the model.        
In addition to condition regressors, WhiteMatter, CSF, Cosine01, Cosine02, Cosine03, Cosine04, Cosine05, Cosine06, Cosine07 and a
high-pass filter of 0.0078125 Hz (implemented using a cosine drift model) were
included in the model.
AR(1) prewhitening was applied in each model to account for temporal
autocorrelation.        


After fitting each model, the parameter estimate (i.e., beta) map
associated with the target trial's regressor was retained and concatenated
into a 4D image with all other trials from the same condition, resulting
in a set of N 4D images where N refers to the number of conditions in the task.
The number of volumes in each 4D image represents the number of trials in that
condition.        

### Atlas Connectivity Analysis

The beta series 4D image for each condition in the task was subjected to an
ROI-to-ROI connectivity analysis to produce a condition-specific correlation
matrix.
The correlation coefficient estimator used for this step was empirical
covariance, as implemented in Nilearn 0.4.2 [@Abraham2014].
Correlation coefficients were converted to normally-distributed z-values using
Fisher's r-to-z conversion [@Fisher1915].
Figures for the correlation matrices were generated with
Matplotlib 2.2.4 [@Hunter2007] and MNE-Python 0.18.2
[@Gramfort2013; @Gramfort2014].
